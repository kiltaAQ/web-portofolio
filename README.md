# Kilta's Portofolio Project

This is my portofolio website. I created this web to document my projects or experiences and also to show it off to clients. Actually I want it to look simple and fresh with light brown color.

## Demo
To see how it's work you can check this link 
[demo link](https://kiltaaq.github.io/web-portofolio/)
 
## External icon 
I use icon from fontawesome. If you want to use it, add script below in your HTML file. 
  ```html
  <script src='https://kit.fontawesome.com/a076d05399.js'></script> 
  ```
Then copy the link icon you want, example
  ```html
  <i class="far fa-envelope"></i>
  ```
  
## Notes
 * I want to change the background
 * Use animation
 * Can send real massage
